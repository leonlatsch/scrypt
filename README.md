# SCrypt File Encrypter

> Note: This was my second "real" project and i created it quite a while ago. Have some mercy



### General

- SCrypt is a Java based program to encrypt and decrypt files.

- It can only process one file at a time.

- Encrypted files are saved with a `.crypt` extension.

- `.crypt` files can then be decrypted again.

- A password is used to create the 256-bit crypto-key.
- You can run it in the terminal, but this is very unstable and also requires JavaFX.

> Note: I plan to create a lite version just for terminal use.
